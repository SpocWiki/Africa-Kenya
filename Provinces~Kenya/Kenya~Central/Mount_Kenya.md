> Mount Kenya (Meru: Kĩrĩmaara, Kikuyu: Kĩrĩmanyaga, Kamba: Ki nyaa, Embu: Kĩ nyaga) 
> is an extinct volcano in Kenya and the second-highest peak in Africa, after Kilimanjaro. 
> 
> The highest peaks of the mountain are Batian (5,199 metres (17,057 feet)), Nelion (5,188 m (17,021 ft)) and Point Lenana (4,985 m (16,355 ft)). 
> 
> Mount Kenya is located in the former Eastern and Central provinces of Kenya; 
> its peak is the intersection of Meru, Embu, Kirinyaga, Nyeri and Tharaka Nithi counties, 
> about 16.5 kilometres (10.3 miles) south of the equator, 
> around 150 km (90 mi) north-northeast of the capital Nairobi. 
> Mount Kenya is the source of the name of the Republic of Kenya.
>
> Mount Kenya is a volcano created approximately 3 million years 
> after the opening of the East African Rift. 
> 
> Before glaciation, it was 7,000 m (23,000 ft) high. 
> It was covered by an ice cap for thousands of years. 
> This has resulted in very eroded slopes and numerous valleys radiating from the peak. 
> There are currently 11 small glaciers, which are shrinking rapidly, and may disappear by 2050. 
> 
> The forested slopes are an important source of water for much of Kenya.
>
> There are several vegetation bands from the base to the peak. 
> The lower slopes are covered by different types of forest. 
> Many alpine species are endemic to Mount Kenya, 
> such as the giant lobelias and senecios and a local subspecies of rock hyrax. 
> 
> An area of 715 km2 (276 sq mi) around the centre of the mountain 
> was designated a National Park in 1949 
> and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. 
> 
> The park receives over 16,000 visitors per year.
